elastix 4.8 compiles with ITK 4.7.2 compiled with the following non-default options:

Module_ITKReview                                        true
  If set to false, elastix does not compile, since we use some classes from the Review directory.


Optionally use ITK_USE_64BITS_IDS and ITK_LEGACY_REMOVE.
